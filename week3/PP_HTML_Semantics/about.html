    </header>

    <p>My name is Kiara Williams. To family and friends I go by "Kiki", or "Ki". Now that I'm older, I prefer "Ki", like a key.</p> 
    <p>I have a 12 year old daughter who is addicted to gymnastics and CoryxKenshin. I'm a surgical assistant and former preschool teacher.</p>
    <p>I am really enjoying the web dev program here at BU.</p>
